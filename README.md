# SAMPL6-Epik-pKa
This repo contains scripts and data for reference pKa calculations for the SAMPL6 pKa challenge using Epik.

Sequential mode
---------------

`output/sequential` contains sequential pKa calculations starting from pH 7, getting all pKas between 2 and 12. 

All microstates 
---------------

`output/states_per_pH` contains full microstate calculations at every pH in the interval 2-12 with steps of .1 pH unit.
